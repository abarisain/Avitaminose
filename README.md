Avitaminose
===========

A typed stack virtual machine.
C# rewrite of Vitamine with a BIOS and RAM.

Easier to hack on, it can be a playground for stuff that would take time to implement, or that could be considered wrong to implement in such a low-level VM (for example, string support)

The aim of this is to be able to run a graphical blockbreaker game in it.
